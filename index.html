<h1>Start your day in a good way</h1>

<p>A <strong>good day</strong> always starts in a good way </p>

<p>I have a <strong>good day</strong> when Lebron makes a good play</p>

<p>You may have a <strong>good day</strong> when you the make right play </p>

<P>But I might say... why isn't everyday a <strong>good day</strong>?</P>
    
<p>You woke up in a good way?</p>

<p>Ate a good plate?</p>

<p>Shower felt great?</p>

<p>You may have even woke up late... but listen...</p>

<p>You woke up great...</p>

<P>You woke up with the ability to seize the date</P>

<p>Who knows what could happen this could end up being the best day of your life...</p>

<P>Take my advice now so you wont have to come back to this twice</P>

<P>You only live once not twice so do what's right and have fun with life</P>

<em>Sincerely Damon, Have a <strong>Good Day</strong>!</em>
